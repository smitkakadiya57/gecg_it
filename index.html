          <h3>About Department</h3>
          <p>
            Department of Information Technology is well poised to cater the
            needs of the Undergraduate Engineering students and works jointly
            with Computer Department. It is equipped with well-developed
            laboratories to satisfy the curriculum of various subjects. Almost
            all fields are computerized to have ease of handling the problems of
            designing, manufacturing, maintenance, servicing, researching,
            marketing and accounting. The B.E. Information Technology program
            includes computer operations on different languages, data
            generation, collection and utilization of information, etc. The
            course imparts all the basics as well as advanced knowledge
            pertaining to the rapidly developing field of Information practices.
            The course is designed to keep students in pace with the practical
            field.This is required for the critical analysis, design, evolution
            and improvement of Information Management systems. It is our
            objective that students should be able to pursue advanced studies in
            Information Technology comprehensively. The college has well
            maintained computer labs which are facilitated with IBM, X series
            Xeon & dual processor Pentium servers, Compaq server and several
            hundred work stations connected in LAN & WAN & Wi-Fi.
